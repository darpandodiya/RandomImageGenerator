Random Image Generator

Simple command line based Java program to generate random images of different file formats.

While doing one project, I needed sets of images to test. Generating such datasets manually is --well not something a programmer should do! :) So I quickly wrote this tool. 

It can generate image dataset by:
1. No of files needed
2. Size of dataset
3. Both, no of files and dataset
