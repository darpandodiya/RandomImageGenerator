Random Image Generator

Simple command line based Java program to generate random images of different file formats.

While doing one project, I needed sets of images to test. Generating such datasets manually is --well not something a programmer should do! :) So I quickly wrote this tool. 

It can generate image dataset by:
1. No of files needed
2. Size of dataset
3. Both, no of files and dataset

Supported extensions:
1. jpg/jpeg
2. png
3. gif

Above choices can be given by entering values in interactive command line execution window. 


Run the program via: java -jar RandomImageGenerator.jar
