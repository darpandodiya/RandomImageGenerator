# Random Image Generator

Simple command line based Java program to generate dataset random valid images. Configured based on size, no of files or both. 

While doing one project, I needed sets of images to test. Generating such datasets manually is --well not something a programmer should do! :) So I quickly wrote this tool. 

It can generate image dataset by:
1. No of files needed
2. Size of dataset
3. Both, no of files and dataset

Supported extensions:
1. jpg/jpeg
2. png
3. gif

Above choices can be given by entering values in interactive command line execution window. 


# Run the program

java -jar RandomImageGenerator.jar
